### 2019-Q4 grant round 
SFF is now seeking applications from organizations for funds we hope to be distributed in December, 2019:

<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPWCYskBtG7sQeKuTtFHi4soqgnkdaLW_yiUN0Eln1GIqjjg/viewform?usp=sf_link">SFF org grant short-form application for 2019-Q4</a> (Due date: Oct 4, 2019)

We expect this funding round will distribute between $1MM and $2MM in total.  SFF is teaming up with philanthropist Jaan Tallinn for this grant round, so some of the final grants will be directed by SFF recommendations, and some will be directed by Jaan.

### About Us 

Survivalandflourishing.org is a website maintained by the Fund Advisors of the Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF), a Donor Advised Fund held at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.

Our goal is to bring financial support to organizations working to improve humanity’s long-term prospects for survival and flourishing.  We use this website to host announcements about our plans to investigate grant-making opportunities.  

SFF was initially funded in 2019 by a grant of approximately $2 million from the Organizational Grants Program of the Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI), which in turn was funded by donations from philanthropist Jaan Tallinn.
