### 2020-H1 grant round 
SFF is holding another grant round to distribute funds in June 2020.  We estimate between $0.8MM and $1.5MM will be distributed in this round.   Applications are due on **April 13** (previously March 7), via the following form:<br>
[SFF-2020-H1 Grant Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpl1y8UBdF0_eU57h1hBku2VUMEdGlFFUJkSirFml_eUx-fA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

We officially extended the application deadline to April 13 because many applicants were late due to difficulties arising from COVID-19.

We are considering running another similar grant round in 2020-H2, but a final decision on this has not been made.

The total funding distributed will be around $2MM, at the high end of our expected $1MM-$2MM estimate. We are considering running another similar grant round in Q2, Q3, or Q4 of 2020, but this decision has not been finalized.

### About Us 

Survivalandflourishing.fund is a website maintained by the Fund Advisors of the Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF), a Donor Advised Fund held at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.

Our goal is to bring financial support to organizations working to improve humanity’s long-term prospects for survival and flourishing.  We use this website to host announcements about our plans to investigate grant-making opportunities.  

SFF was initially funded in 2019 by a grant of approximately $2 million from the Organizational Grants Program of the Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI), which in turn was funded by donations from philanthropist Jaan Tallinn.
